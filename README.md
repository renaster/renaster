feel free to int; especially if these are your interests! 

- Persona, NSO, Zeno, Bandori -w-

recommend me media, as I am always searching for new interests! <3

dni if:
- homophobic/transphobic; I'm literally trans and in a mlm relationship.
- racist; it's not cool, and yes you can be racist even if you aren't white.
- weird; weird skins aren't funny, and don't excuse harassment. Do NOT ask me if I want to be your girlfriend/boyfriend. I am a man and I am in a relationship. This has happened too many times.
- Dead Plate/Evevator Hitch, Okegom, Ranfen, and DSMP.

You may be asking yourself why these are on my dni; here are explanations:
- The Dead Plate/Elevator Hitch- Forced mlm.
- Okegom- self explanitory.
- Ranfren- Slurs, an asain character is literally named "Rat" HELLO????, Pro-ships (canon or not it's disgusting.)
- DSMP- Fandom is weird and the people involved are problematic.

Thanks for understanding!
